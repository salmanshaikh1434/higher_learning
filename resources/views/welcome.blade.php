			<p style="line-height:30px;text-align: justify;">In my view the key to all progress and innovation is education. Irrespective of its institutional nature, education, formal, informal, through a regular mode or distant and online mode, the programs of education and training. I believe are the most sacred missions in our society. Apart from contributing to progress and development, education also aims at creating a civic society, Law and enforcement. rules and regulations are crucial for the maintenance of our civic society, but the education alone can generate the required awareness to follow them and the sensuality to appreciate them. For thousands of years in civilized society, education has redeemed millions of people from poverty and oppression and created a climate of social justice."</p>

				<h2>Mission</h2>
<h4>Quality, Excellence, Integrity and the Pursuit of Knowledge</h4>

<p style="line-height:30px;text-align: justify;">At Dr. Rafiq Zakaria Institute of higher learning and advance research we are seriously concerned about maintaining the quality of higher education and research in our country. The UGC has issued a third amendment that aims at improving the situation. Universities at large are heavily burdened by the increasing pressure of students desiring to seek quality education and excel in research. Dr. Rafiq Zakaria Institute of higher learning and advance research proposes to share a part of that national burden. Our mission is to develop capacity building programmes for all sections of the student community, particularly focusing on the minority and under privileged sections of society. 
We believe that the untapped knowledge resources of these communities, their rich and diversified funds of traditional wisdom need to be adequately harnessed for the regional as well as national growth. Our mission is to discover, innovate and restructure the plurality of knowledge resources into the strong national streams of unity in diversity and solidarity in plurality. 
Students and researchers are not outsiders at our Centre, they are an integral part of it. By seeking counselling and advise they do not disturb the work of the faculty, instead they are the purpose of their work. By seeking admission to our Centre they are doing us a favour, they are giving us an opportunity to serve a national cause â€“ the development of highly qualified human resource. </p>


<h2>Objectives</h2>
<ul style="line-height:30px;text-align: justify;">
	<li>To provide quality education and opportunities for research at an affordable cost</li>

	<li>The inculcation of secular values in higher learning and research proposals.</li>

	<li>To eliminate caste, gender and religious bias through the principles of quality, excellence and the pursuit of knowledge.</li>

	<li>To improve the quality of human resources through a rigorous pursuit of self-improvement, skills development and a professional aptitude.</li>

	<li>To forge regional, national and international bonds between the academic community.</li>

	<li>To build a massive consortium of knowledge resources using traditional means and modern technology.</li>

	<li>To promote individual, group and collaborative research that will ultimately benefit various sectors in social transformation.</li>

	<li>To promote alternative modes of debate and social thinking.</li>

	<li>To open up the gates of knowledge to those sections of society who have been oppressed and denied for decades after Independence.</li>

	<li>To collaborate in the pursuit of social justice and equality through the acquisition of knowledge and professional skills.</li>
</ul>
